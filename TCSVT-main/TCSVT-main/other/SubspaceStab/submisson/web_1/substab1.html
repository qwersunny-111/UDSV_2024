  <h1>Problem Statement</h1>
  <p>In this project I'll implement<a href="http://web.cecs.pdx.edu/~fliu/project/subspace_stabilization">Subspace Video Stabilization</a>
  algorithm (Liu et al.)</p>
  <p>Most videos captured by hand held cameras are degenerated by
  undesired shakings. The goal of video stabilization is to re-render
  shaky videos into smoother ones, as shown in the following demo:</p>

  <h2>Algorithm</h2>
  <p>The intuition of this algorithm is to smooth feature tracks
  through the video, and then warp all frames based on new feature
  locations. Features are tracked through standard KLT tracking
  algorithm, and the final warpping is performed the same way as
  existing 3D video stabilization algorithm does
  (<a href="http://web.cecs.pdx.edu/~fliu/project/3dstab.htm">Liu et
  al, 2009</a>). The core contribution of this paper is to propose a
  simple and robust algorithm for feature tracks smoothing.</p>
  <p>Naively smoothing feature tracks will introduce artifacts when
  the track does not span across the whole sequence. This paper solve
  this problem by enforce the subspace constraint to smoothed feature
  locations.</p>
  <p>Under the assumption of rigid static scenes and affine camera,
  the motions of all features should reside on a low-dimensional
  subspace. Even if this does not hold for commonly used perspective
  cameras, the motion in a small temporal window still approximately
  follows this low-rank constraint. The algorithm
  smooth the video in a moving window fashion. Inside each temporal
  window, the algorithm characterizes the camera motion by 9 degrees
  of freedom, which is computed by PCA.</p>
